### What I learned

I learnt alot durring this challenge. It was really great to use the SCSS language.
I really improved my knowledge in targeting content with CSS precisely.

Furthermore, I also learnt alot in Flexboxes and I feel that I now have a greater understading with them and how to implement and use them in the future.
I also learnt how to use Node.js to add the means to use SCSS in my task which was really great.

Some code below:

```html
<p>Coded by <a href="https://github.com/andrepaiva96" target="_blank">Andre Paiva</a></p>
```

```scss
content {
  height: calc(100% - 60px);
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue my development in Flexboxes and Media Queries.
I would like to gain a stronger understanding in Media Queries and how to create and maintain them even better.
In this project I also used SCSS, I will continue my development with this as I feel as it is a very useful language
